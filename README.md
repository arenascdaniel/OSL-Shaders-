# OSL-Shaders-

OSL utilities that can be usefull for make easier the life of look-dev artists.

Roadmap
  Texture utilities
  
    WIP NormRot.- correct tangent space normal vector in rotated textures in Uv space.

    DispTool.- easy management of displacement textures

    MixDisp.- mix textures by displacement

    BlendingModes.- texture mixer that allows you to use traditional blending modes easily

    TxTileMix.- this node is mixing ramdomly textures in a grid pattern. Use for avoiding visual repetitions on large tiled textures as brick walls.

    TxBombing.- (or auto tile,) this node rotating scaling and traslating and seamlesly mixing a texture in a cell pattern to make the illusion of seamless texture


  Shaders
  
    Simple two specular shader with tags for LPEs
    
    
  Functions
  
    Fuctions that can be used along OSL code
